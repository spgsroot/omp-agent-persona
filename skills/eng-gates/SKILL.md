description: Deterministic quality gates for Rust, Python and JS/TS - format, lint, types, tests, module boundaries, CRAP, duplication, mutation, benchmarks, plus guards against weakening the gates. Use after every unit of code change (gate fast), before calling work done or in review (gate full), when setting gates up in a repo (init, doctor), and whenever a gate fails and you must fix it.

# eng-gates

Gates decide when code is done. You do not. A task is finished only when `gate full` passes.

Runner: `python3 tools/eng-gates/gate.py` inside a repo that ran `init`, otherwise
`python3 <this skill>/scripts/gate.py`. Add `-C <dir>` to point at another project.
Windows: `python3` is the Microsoft Store stub - substitute `python` (or `uv run python`) everywhere below;
the ub checks (`ub.crap`, `ub.dry`, `ub.mutate`) are unavailable there and report as a missing tool.

## Loop

1. Make one small change (one test, one function, one refactor step).
2. `gate.py fast` - seconds. Format, lint, types, tests, module boundaries, both guards. Changed files only.
3. Red: fix the first failure, rerun. Do not start the next unit while fast is red.
4. Unit done → commit (why, what, how it was proven).
5. Before saying "done", before review, before push: `gate.py full` - adds dependency audit, unused deps,
   CRAP, duplication, mutation, benchmarks, bundle size.
6. Report: paste the final summary line of `gate full`, and list every `WARN guard.suppress` entry.

Output: one line per check, then the tail of each failure. The full report is in `.gates/last.json`;
read it instead of rerunning. `--json` prints it. `--only rust,guard` runs a subset. `--all` checks the whole tree.

## Fixing failures - what is and is not allowed

| Failure | Fix | Never |
|---|---|---|
| `rust.clippy`, `py.lint`, `ts.lint` | change the code the lint names | `#[allow]`, `# noqa`, `eslint-disable` without `gate-allow: <reason>` |
| `*.types` | model the type properly, parse at the boundary | `as any`, `# type: ignore`, `@ts-ignore`, casts to silence |
| `*.test` | fix the code, or the test if the test is wrong about the requirement | loosen assertions, delete cases, skip, mock the unit under test |
| `py.imports`, `ts.deps` | move code to the right layer, introduce a port (trait / protocol / interface) in the lower layer | import across the boundary "just this once" |
| `ub.crap` | split the function, or test its branches, or both | delete branches you have not proven dead |
| `ub.dry` | extract the shared shape once it is the same decision | merge code that only looks alike but changes for different reasons |
| `ub.mutate` | add an assertion that kills the survivor; delete code no test can reach | assert on implementation details |
| `*.bench` | find the cause with a profiler, fix it, show the new number | change the baseline or the budget |
| `rust.deny`, `py.deps`, `ts.knip`, `rust.machete` | remove or replace the dependency, delete dead exports | add ignores |
| `guard.config` | revert your edit to the protected file | run `gate.py approve` (humans only) |
| `guard.suppress` | remove the suppression; if it is truly right, add `gate-allow: <reason>` on that line | hide it with a broader suppression |

If a rule itself is wrong for this codebase, stop and say which rule and why. A human changes the config.
`skip` lines are not failures, but `missing tool` skips mean the gate is incomplete: say so in the report.

Details per tool, and how to read each output: `references/gates.md`.

## Performance

- Prove claims with numbers from the bench gate, not reasoning.
- Gate on deterministic counts: gungraun (Rust, instruction counts via Valgrind, Linux) or CodSpeed simulation
  mode. Wall-clock numbers on shared machines swing more than most regressions; use them only to investigate.
- To find the cause: `samply` / `cargo flamegraph` / DHAT (Rust), `py-spy` / `memray` / `scalene` (Python),
  `node --cpu-prof` / `--heap-prof` (JS). Fix the hot path, then rerun the bench gate.
- Baselines live in `benches/baselines/` and are protected. A human accepts a new baseline.
- Patterns to look for and to avoid: `references/performance.md`.

## Setting up a repo (human-assisted)

1. `python3 <skill>/scripts/gate.py init` - copies templates (never overwrites without `--force`), vendors the
   runner into `tools/eng-gates/` for CI, adds `.gates/` state to `.gitignore`, prints manual merge steps.
2. `bash <skill>/scripts/install-tools.sh` - installs missing tools for the detected languages and clones
   crapper / dryer / mutator into `~/.local/share/eng-gates/ub`.
3. `gate.py doctor` - every check: `ok` (tool path), `MISS` (install it), `--` (not configured), `off`.
4. Legacy code: run `gate.py full --all` once to see the debt, then keep the default changed-files scope so
   only touched code must meet the bar. Never lower thresholds to make the first run green; scope instead.
5. A human reviews and commits the config. CI runs `gate.py full` with `CI=1` (missing tools fail, local
   approvals are ignored). Protect the same paths with CODEOWNERS / branch protection: the local guard is a
   tripwire, the server-side rule is the lock.

## Config

`gates.toml` in the repo root (protected): base ref, timeout, CRAP / duplication thresholds, tool paths,
per-check `enabled` / `tier` / `cmd` / `requires`, and custom checks (`[check."llm.latency"]`).
The template documents every key.
